# employee-directory-react

## description:
This [React](https://reactjs.org/) app allows a user to search for employees and their non-sensitive information. Right now the categories are First or Last name, Location, Role, and Department. 

Made with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and uses [Bootstrap's CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/), assembled by me, [Lee Chenalloy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-chenalloy/)!

Test out the site deployed on ZEIT Now [here](https://employee-directory-react.now.sh/).

#### features: 
* User can sort employees alphabetically by category.
* User can choose to sort employees ascending or descending.
* User can search by searchbar entry.
* User can search by searchbar entry where query is found in chosen category.

Default search is by any value match, and default sort is by id ascending (id sort is not available for users to select).

## final thoughts:
This is my first React app, so I learned a lot using it. Although I used Create React App so I didn't have to manually set up Webpack, I chose to not use other libraries such as React Table so I could get used to working with as 'vanilla' React as possible. For this reason, I have yet to implement React Hooks as well but I will probably refactor this app to make more use of props, hooks, and components. I chose to use Bootstrap to make styling faster, but I had a lot of fun debugging the battle of the styles between Bootstrap's stylesheet and my custom styles! 

(Sidenote: I injected a little fun by using [Haikyuu!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haikyu!!) characters as my dummy data for now because I love sports anime üòäüèê)
